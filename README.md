Text classification is a natural language processing (NLP) task that involves assigning a category to a piece of text. 
In the case of movie reviews, the categories would be positive, negative, or neutral.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how text classification can be used to analyze movie reviews. By 
classifying movie reviews, we can gain insights into the public's perception of movies. This information can be 
used by movie studios to make better decisions about which movies to produce and market.

Movie sentiment analysis is a powerful tool for understanding and analyzing the sentiments expressed in 
movie reviews. Through sentiment analysis, we can gain valuable insights into audience opinions and perceptions, 
which have various applications in the film industry. Here are key conclusions regarding movie sentiment analysis:
◼ Audience Sentiment Understanding.
◼ Marketing Insights.
◼ Recommendation Systems.
◼ Content Evaluation and Improvement.
◼ Market Research and Competitive
